# Timed one-time-password (TOTP) application

Made with Angular 12 and Material.

Ready-to-use: https://totp.cv.co.hu

Needs javascript and access to localStorage. Does not send any data to any server, everything is stored locally - which means, if you clear your browsing data or use in incognito, it will lose whatever tokens were added, so be aware.

## Build yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deejayy/totp-app
cd totp-app
npm i
ng b
```
